# Applying DTW Across Time Series Domains
Time series data permeates our world, from the fluctuations of stock markets to the rhythms of speech and the intricate signals of medical diagnostics. Extracting meaningful information from these temporal sequences requires robust analytical techniques. One powerful tool that stands out is Dynamic Time Warping (DTW).
