# A Customized Controller for multi-utility plus AI Analytics.md
Here describes a versatile, small PCB designed for multiple electronics projects.  The board includes common components like a relay with driver transistor, an LED indicator, an 8-pin PIC12Fxxx microcontroller socket, an optional power supply (supporting both higher and lower voltage inputs), jumpers for reset/setup, and a programming/peripheral connector.

The schematic is fully populated, but not all components need to be installed for every project.  The power supply section can be configured for different input voltages.  I/O pins are accessible via X2 and X4, with jumpers and resistors allowing for flexible configuration with the microcontroller's GP0, GP1, GP2, and GP4 pins.  Noise suppression capacitors (C4, C5, C6) can be replaced with LEDs (LD3, LD4) for output indication.  Q2 provides a higher current/voltage output option, or it can be replaced with an LED (LED2).  R7 and R8 allow for microcontroller settings.  JP3 is for programming or a USB-to-serial adapter.  A resistor array (RN1) is used for pull-up resistors, with the option to use a discrete resistor (R9).  A relay driver circuit (Q1, D2, RY1) is included, but can be omitted if not needed.
