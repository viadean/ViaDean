# üêåBinary Semaphores plus AI Analytics
A semaphore is a mechanism that controls access to a shared resource by allowing tasks to block until permission is granted.  A *binary semaphore* has two states: "taken" and "given."  A task must "take" the semaphore before accessing the resource. If the semaphore is already "taken," the task blocks until it's "given" again.  Semaphores themselves don't protect the resource; protection is achieved by *protocol* ‚Äì tasks agree to only access the resource if they successfully "take" the semaphore.
